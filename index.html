                    I am a student of Law. But this subject is not my type.
                    Sometime I feel like I am westing money of our government.
                    If a person who likes Law was in my position, he/she could
                    do a lots of progress. As I don't like Law that's why I
                    learned Web Development and you can hire me.

                        They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a
                        reknown web developer. I made their website and showed
                        it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It
                        was fun working as programing hero.
